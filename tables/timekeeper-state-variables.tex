    \\ \midrule
    \localTime
     & The party \party's current timestamp in the form of
    \protocolTime{\interval}{\round}.
    \\ \midrule
    \interval
     & The interval that \round belongs to.
    \\ \midrule
    \epoch
     & The epoch that \round belongs to.
    \\ \midrule
    \chainLocal
     & The local chain the party adopts based on which it does mining and
    exports the ledger state.
    \\ \midrule
    \buffer
     & A buffer of transactions.
    \\  \midrule
    \futureChains
     & A buffer to store chains with blocks whose timestamps belong to the
    future (logical) rounds.
    \\ \midrule
    $\mathsf{arrivalTime}_{SB}(\cdot)$
     & A map that assigns to each synchronization beacon a pair $(a, b)$,
    where $a$ is the arrival time and $b$ is an indication of whether $a$
    is \textsf{final} or \textsf{temp}.
    \\ \midrule
    $\mathsf{arrivalTime}(\cdot)$
     & Shorthand for the first (arrival time) element of the pair $\mathsf{arrivalTime}_{SB}(\cdot)$.
    \\ \midrule
    \isSync
     & A bit variable to store the synchronization status.
    \\ \midrule
    $\mathtt{fetchCompleted}$
     & A variable to store whether the round messages have been fetched.
    \\ \midrule
    $\mathtt{lastTimeAlert}$
     & The timestamp which stores the last alert time. Used for rejoining if
    the party was only stalled.
