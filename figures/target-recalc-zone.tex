        In the first and the last row (regarding [nominal] time and Env.), \fcolorbox{themeColor3!80}{themeColor3!80}{\rule{0pt}{5pt}\rule{5pt}{0pt}} indicates the protocol execution is in epoch $\epoch - 1$; \fcolorbox{themeColor2!80}{themeColor2!80}{\rule{0pt}{5pt}\rule{5pt}{0pt}} implies the execution is in epoch \epoch; and \fcolorbox{themeColor!80}{themeColor!80}{\rule{0pt}{5pt}\rule{5pt}{0pt}} shows the target recalculation zone $Z_\epoch$.

        Regarding parties, \fcolorbox{themeColor3!80}{themeColor3!80}{\rule{0pt}{5pt}\rule{5pt}{0pt}} represents RO queries w.r.t. $\epoch - 1$, and \fcolorbox{themeColor2!80}{themeColor2!80}{\rule{0pt}{5pt}\rule{5pt}{0pt}} represents RO queries w.r.t. \epoch.
